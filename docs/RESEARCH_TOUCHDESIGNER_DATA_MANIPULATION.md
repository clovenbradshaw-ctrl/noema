# TouchDesigner Research: Data Manipulation & Layout for Compositions

Research into TouchDesigner's capabilities for manipulating data and laying it out for visual compositions.

## Overview

TouchDesigner is a node-based visual programming environment where **all data is fundamentally numeric**. 3D geometry is lists of XYZ positions, CHOPs are signals and numbers, and even pixels inside TOPs are just numbers with different ranges (8-bit or 32-bit). This unified numeric foundation allows fluid conversion between operator families.

## Operator Families

TouchDesigner organizes operators into families, each representing data differently:

| Family | Purpose | Data Type |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| **TOPs** (Texture Operators) | Image/video processing, compositing | 2D pixel data |
| **CHOPs** (Channel Operators) | Motion, audio, control signals | Time-based numeric channels |
| **SOPs** (Surface Operators) | 3D geometry manipulation | Point/primitive data |
| **DATs** (Data Operators) | Text, tables, scripts | String/table data |
| **COMPs** (Component Operators) | Network organization, UI | Container structures |
| **POPs** (Point Operators) | GPU-based 3D data (new in 2025) | Point cloud/particle data |

**Data flows left-to-right**: inputs on left, outputs on right.

---

## Data Manipulation Techniques

### 1. Table DAT - Structured Data

The **Table DAT** is the primary tool for organizing structured data:

- **Manual Editing**: Right-click to add rows/columns, Tab to navigate cells
- **Procedural Filling**: Fill Type options include Set Size, Fill by Column, Fill by Row
- **External Data**: Load `.csv`, `.tsv`, or `.dat` files; supports HTTP URLs for web data
- **Python Access**: `op('table1')[row, col].val` returns cell string value

**Locking for modification**:
```python
table.lock = 1  # Lock to enable editing
table.lock = 0  # Unlock (reloads from source file)
```

### 2. Data Conversion Operators

Convert between operator families seamlessly:

| Conversion | Operator | Use Case |
|------------|----------|----------|
| CHOP → SOP | `CHOP to SOP` | Create 3D geometry from channel data |
| SOP → CHOP | `SOP to CHOP` | Extract point attributes as channels |
| CHOP → DAT | `CHOP to DAT` | Convert channels to table format |
| DAT → CHOP | `DAT to CHOP` | Convert table rows to channels |
| TOP → CHOP | `TOP to CHOP` | Sample pixel values as channels |
| CHOP → TOP | `CHOP to TOP` | Visualize channel data as image |

### 3. CHOP to SOP Workflow

The `CHOP to SOP` operator converts channel data into 3D geometry:

- **Input Required**: This is a Filter operator (needs geometry input)
- **Channel Mapping**: Three channels map to XYZ positions
- **Attribute Scope**: Specify which attributes to modify
- **Group Parameter**: Optionally modify only specific point groups

---

## Layout & Compositing (TOPs)

### Layout TOP

Used for arranging multiple visual sources in a composition.

### Tile TOP

Creates repeating patterns from input images:

- **Repeat X/Y**: Number of tiles in each direction
- **Flip/Reflect**: Mirror tiles in X or Y
- **Overlap U/V**: Blend edges between tiles
- **Extend Modes**: Hold, Zero, Repeat, or Mirror at edges

### Composite TOP

Multi-input compositing with layer operations:

- **Fixed Layer**: Designate which input is the base layer
- **Pre-Fit Overlay**: Fill, Fit Horizontal, Fit Vertical options
- **Translate Step**: Create tile blocks with adjustable sequences
- **Operation Types**: Over, Under, Add, Multiply, etc.

### Layer Mix TOP (New in 2025)

Per-layer compositing controls:
- Crop, scale, rotation, translation, pivot
- Opacity, brightness, levels
- Independent composite operation per layer

---

## Instancing for Data-Driven Visualization

**Instancing** efficiently renders multiple copies of geometry using a single source model.

### Key Concepts

1. **Geometry COMP**: The building block for instancing setups
2. **Instance Sources**: CHOP samples, DAT table rows, TOP pixels, or SOP points
3. **Per-Instance Attributes**: Position, scale, rotation, color

### Instance Data Sources

| Source | Channels/References |
|--------|---------------------|
| CHOP | `p(0)`, `p(1)`, `p(2)` |
| TOP | R, G, B, A channels |
| DAT | Table row values |
| SOP | Point attributes |

### Workflow

1. Create Geometry COMP with source geometry
2. Enable instancing in Geometry COMP parameters
3. Connect data source (CHOP, DAT, TOP, or SOP)
4. Map attributes to instance properties (tx/ty/tz, sx/sy/sz, rx/ry/rz)

---

## Point Operators (POPs) - New in 2025

POPs are a **GPU-based operator family** for high-performance 3D data manipulation.

### Key Features

- **GPU-Resident Computing**: All calculations stay on GPU, avoiding CPU round-trips
- **Point Attributes**: Position, normal, color, plus custom user-defined attributes
- **No Shader Coding Required**: Modern procedural tools without GLSL
- **Millions of Points**: Real-time performance for massive point clouds/particles

### Use Cases

- Particle systems with millions of points
- Real-time complex geometry animation
- Massive data manipulation
- DMX/LED/laser output workflows

### Integration

- Render directly via **Render TOP**
- Export to CHOPs for DMX, lasers, external systems
- Seamless interop with TOPs (both GPU-based)

### System Requirements

- **Minimum**: 4GB GPU memory
- **Recommended**: 8GB+ GPU memory for POPs
- **Supported**: NVIDIA 50-series (Blackwell) GPUs

## Python Scripting for Automation

### Execute DATs

Event-driven scripting via callback DATs:

| DAT Type | Trigger |
|----------|---------|
| **DAT Execute** | Changes in DAT table content |
| **OP Execute** | Operator changes (name, children, wiring) |
| **Panel Execute** | UI panel interactions |
| **Parameter Execute** | Parameter value changes |
| **Execute** | System events (startup, save, operator creation) |

### Execute DAT Callbacks

```python
def onFrameStart():
    # Called at start of every frame
    pass

def onFrameEnd():
    # Called at end of every frame
    pass

def onDeviceChange():
    # Called when devices connect/disconnect
    pass

def onTableChange(dat):
    # Called when table contents change (2025.30000+)
    pass
```

### Script Operators

Create custom operator behavior with Script OPs:
- **Script CHOP**: Generate custom channel data
- **Script SOP**: Generate custom geometry
- **onCook callback**: Define behavior when operator cooks

### Performance Note

Native C++/GLSL operators generally outperform Python for signal processing. Use Python for:
- Complex logic that's hard to express as nodes
- External library integration
- Automation and workflow tools

## Data-Driven Visualization Patterns

### Pattern 1: Table to Instanced Geometry

```
Table DAT → DAT to CHOP → Geometry COMP (instancing)
```

### Pattern 2: Audio-Reactive Visuals

```
Audio Device In CHOP → Math CHOP → CHOP to SOP → Geometry COMP
```

### Pattern 3: Procedural Layout

```
Noise CHOP → CHOP to TOP → Composite TOP → Layout composition
```

### Pattern 4: Data Import Pipeline

```
Web DAT (fetch CSV) → Table DAT → Insert DAT (headers) → Instancing
```

## Lessons for Noema Data Workbench

After analyzing both TouchDesigner's approach and Noema's architecture, here are specific learnings:

### 1. Visual Pipeline Builder for Formulas

**TouchDesigner**: Node-based visual programming where data flows left-to-right through connected operators.

**Noema Currently**: Formula pipelines are text-based: `{Orders} → CON(Customer) → SEG(Status="Complete") → SYN(SUM Amount)`

**Opportunity**: Build a visual formula editor where users drag-and-drop the Nine Operators (CON, SEG, SYN, ALT, DES, NUL, etc.) as nodes and wire them together. Each node shows a live preview of intermediate results.

```
┌─────────┐    ┌─────────┐    ┌─────────┐    ┌─────────┐
│ Orders  │───▶│  CON    │───▶│  SEG    │───▶│  SYN    │
│  (Set)  │    │Customer │    │Complete │    │SUM Amt  │
│ 150 rec │    │ 150 rec │    │  42 rec │    │ $12,450 │
└─────────┘    └─────────┘    └─────────┘    └─────────┘
```

This mirrors TouchDesigner's core UX while staying true to the Nine Operators.

---

### 2. Operator Family Metaphor for View Types

**TouchDesigner**: Different operator families (TOPs, CHOPs, SOPs, DATs) represent the same underlying numeric data in specialized ways.

**Noema Currently**: 6 view types (Grid, Cards, Kanban, Calendar, Graph, Timeline) are separate rendering modes.

**Opportunity**: Frame views as "data representations" rather than just display modes:

| Noema View | TD Equivalent | Data Representation |
|------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Grid | DAT (Table) | Rows × Columns |
| Cards | TOP (Tiles) | 2D spatial arrangement |
| Graph | SOP (Geometry) | Nodes and edges in space |
| Timeline | CHOP (Channels) | Values over time |
| Kanban | Custom composite | Grouped columns |
| Calendar | Custom composite | Temporal grid |

**Benefit**: Users understand that switching views doesn't change data—just its representation. This aligns with the GIVEN/MEANT distinction.

---

### 3. Instancing for Efficient Record Rendering

**TouchDesigner**: Renders thousands of geometry instances from a single template, driven by table data.

**Noema Currently**: Each card/row is rendered individually in the DOM.

**Opportunity**: For Cards and Graph views with many records:
- Define a single "card template" (like Geometry COMP)
- Instance it for each record, mapping fields to visual properties
- Use Canvas/WebGL for massive datasets (like POPs use GPU)

**Implementation Path**:
```
Record Data (DAT-like)
    ↓ Map fields to visual properties
Template Component (COMP-like)
    ↓ Instance per record
Canvas/WebGL Renderer (GPU-like)
```

This could enable rendering 10,000+ cards smoothly in the Cards view.

---

### 4. Data Conversion Operators

**TouchDesigner**: Explicit conversion operators (`CHOP to SOP`, `DAT to CHOP`) make data transformations visible.

**Noema Currently**: Type coercion happens implicitly in formulas.

**Opportunity**: Make data shape transformations explicit operations:

| Conversion | Use Case |
|------------|----------|
| Set → Graph | Convert records + links to nodes + edges |
| Timeline → Set | Flatten temporal data to snapshot |
| Grouped → Pivoted | Restructure aggregations |
| Records → Statistics | Generate summary Set from data |

These could be first-class operators in the Nine Operator family, making data reshaping visible and auditable (maintaining provenance).

---

### 5. Multi-Representation Preview

**TouchDesigner**: Every operator shows a live preview of its output; you see data transform in real-time.

**Noema Currently**: Formula results appear in the final column; intermediate steps are invisible.

**Opportunity**: In the visual pipeline builder (Lesson #1), show live previews at each stage:
- After CON: "Joined 150 orders with 45 customers"
- After SEG: "Filtered to 42 complete orders"
- After SYN: "Summed to $12,450"

This provides transparency (aligns with Nine Rules) and helps users understand their data transformations.

---

### 6. Procedural Layout Controls

**TouchDesigner**: Tile TOP and Composite TOP provide precise control over spatial arrangement.

**Noema Currently**: Cards view uses CSS grid/flexbox with limited configuration.

**Opportunity**: Add layout controls inspired by Tile/Composite TOPs:

- **Tile Mode**: Repeat cards in X×Y grid with configurable gap
- **Overlap/Blend**: Cards can partially overlap (useful for timeline-style layouts)
- **Extend Behavior**: What happens at edges (clip, wrap, fade)
- **Transform per-item**: Per-card scale/rotation based on field values

Example: Scale card size by `{Amount}` field, tint by `{Category}` field.

---

### 7. Horizon-Gated Instancing

**TouchDesigner**: Instance visibility can be controlled by data attributes.

**Noema Alignment**: This maps perfectly to Horizon-Gated Access (Rule 4).

**Opportunity**: When instancing records for visualization:
- Automatically filter instances by current Horizon
- Different users see different subsets of the same view
- Animate transitions when horizon changes (records fade in/out)

---

### 8. Event-Driven Reactivity (Execute DATs)

**TouchDesigner**: Execute DATs fire callbacks when data changes.

**Noema Currently**: Event bus notifies components of changes.

**Opportunity**: Expose user-configurable triggers:
- "When record added to {Set}, run {Action}"
- "When field value changes, recalculate {Formula}"
- "When horizon narrows, highlight affected records"

This could enable automation workflows while maintaining provenance (every action traced to trigger event).

---

### Summary: Key Takeaways

| TouchDesigner Concept | Noema Application | Priority |
|-----------------------|-------------------|----------|
| Visual node pipelines | Formula builder UI | High |
| Live preview at each node | Intermediate result display | High |
| Instancing for efficiency | Canvas/WebGL card rendering | Medium |
| Operator families | View type framing | Low (conceptual) |
| Tile/Layout controls | Cards view configuration | Medium |
| Data conversion operators | Explicit reshape operations | Medium |
| Execute callbacks | User-defined triggers | Low |

The highest-impact changes would be:
1. **Visual formula builder** with live previews at each stage
2. **Instanced rendering** for large datasets in Cards/Graph views
3. **Temporal pipeline cooking** - scrub through time and watch data transform

Both maintain Noema's philosophical integrity while borrowing TD's excellent UX patterns.

---

### 9. Cook + Loop: Time-Travel Through Data

**The Core Insight**: TouchDesigner's "cook" model (operators process inputs → produce output) combined with Noema's immutable event log enables something neither tool has alone: **scrubbing through time while watching pipelines transform**.

**TouchDesigner's Cook Model**:
- Operators "cook" when inputs change or timeline advances
- Playhead scrubs through time; everything re-evaluates
- You see data transform frame-by-frame

**Noema's Temporal Foundation**:
- Every event is timestamped and immutable (Rule 3: Ineliminability)
- ALT operator reconstructs state at any point: `AS_OF(timestamp)`
- Full audit trail means you can replay history exactly

**The Synthesis - Temporal Pipeline Cooking**:

```
Timeline Scrubber
     ↓ AS_OF(t)
┌─────────┐    ┌─────────┐    ┌─────────┐    ┌─────────┐
│ Orders  │───▶│  CON    │───▶│  SEG    │───▶│  SYN    │
│ @t=Jan  │    │ 45 cust │    │ 12 done │    │ $3,200  │
└─────────┘    └─────────┘    └─────────┘    └─────────┘
     ↓ scrub forward
┌─────────┐    ┌─────────┐    ┌─────────┐    ┌─────────┐
│ Orders  │───▶│  CON    │───▶│  SEG    │───▶│  SYN    │
│ @t=Mar  │    │ 67 cust │    │ 42 done │    │ $12,450 │
└─────────┘    └─────────┘    └─────────┘    └─────────┘
```

**What This Enables**:

1. **Replay History**: Scrub timeline to watch how your data evolved
   - "What did our pipeline show on March 15th?"
   - See exactly what any user saw at any moment

2. **Loop Detection**: Run pipeline at t, t+1, t+2... detect cycles or drift
   - "Are these values converging or diverging?"
   - Spot feedback loops in linked data

3. **Provenance Animation**: Watch the grounding chain build over time
   - Records appear as they're imported
   - Interpretations layer on top
   - See which MEANT events derive from which GIVEN

4. **Comparative Cooking**: Run same pipeline at two timepoints side-by-side
   - "Before/after this import"
   - "Q1 vs Q2 with same formula"

5. **Hypothesis Testing**: Fork at a timestamp, make changes, compare trajectories
   - "What if we had classified this differently?"
   - Branch timelines diverge visually

**Implementation Concept**:

```javascript
// Pipeline node evaluates at horizon's timestamp
function cookNode(node, horizon) {
  const asOfData = eventStore.query({
    ...horizon,
    asOf: horizon.timestamp  // ALT operator
  });

  return node.operator.evaluate(asOfData);
}

// Timeline scrubber triggers re-cook
function onTimelineScrub(newTimestamp) {
  const horizon = { ...currentHorizon, timestamp: newTimestamp };
  pipeline.nodes.forEach(node => {
    node.output = cookNode(node, horizon);
    node.renderPreview();  // Live update
  });
}
```

**Why This Is Unique**:

| Tool | Has Cooking | Has Time-Travel | Has Both |
|------|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| TouchDesigner | ✓ | ✗ (real-time only) | ✗ |
| Airtable | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Git | ✗ | ✓ (commits) | ✗ |
| Noema + TD patterns | ✓ | ✓ | **✓** |

No existing tool lets you visually scrub through a data transformation pipeline's history. This would be a genuine innovation - making Noema's philosophical commitment to temporal integrity into an interactive, visual experience.

**Key Alignment with Nine Rules**:
- **Rule 3 (Ineliminability)**: Nothing erased, so full history available to cook
- **Rule 6 (Coherence)**: Pipeline valid at t stays valid at t' when narrowing
- **Rule 7 (Groundedness)**: Watch provenance chains form in real-time
- **Rule 8 (Determinacy)**: See how meaning crystallizes at specific timestamps
